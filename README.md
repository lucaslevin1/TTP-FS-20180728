# TTP Application Challenge

Lucas Levin's stock portfolio app submission for the TTP application challenge.  Application is built with Node, Express, PG, Sequelize, React, Redux and Semantic UI React.

Notes:

- Don't forget to run npm install upon forking/cloning the application and setting up a postgres db on your machine titled 'ttp-stocks'
- You can seed the database with 2 users and 3 trades by running npm run seed

Enjoy!
